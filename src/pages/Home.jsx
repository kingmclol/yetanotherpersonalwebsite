              Look at the site without animations! It's way more boring that
              way. In my opinion, of course.

              It's <span className="text-xs">supposed</span> to be easy to do
              for quite large benefit. Key word being "supposed" since I'm
              having a bad time right now as this library is like what
            </p>
            <p>
              I won't deny that I may have gone a bit... overboard on this
              though since I'm treating it as a learning opportunity now. Just
              turn off them with the button above if they're too distracting.

              CSS is the stuff of nightmares man, I'm just hoping that

              You can contact me, I guess. But adding an issue on the{" "}

              most code is mine (you can tell from it being terrible), i only
              really use it when styling is kicking my butt + motion

            <p>
              oh yeah and also debugging some stuff (motion ofc) + writing some
